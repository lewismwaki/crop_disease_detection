Apple___Apple_scab,"Apple scab is caused by the fungus *Venturia inaequalis*, producing olive‑green to brown velvety lesions that turn black as they mature. Symptoms typically begin in cool, wet springs on leaves and developing fruit. Infected leaves may yellow, drop prematurely, and fruit can become cracked, corky, and misshapen. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves and spreads via airborne spores in spring. Effective management involves pruning for airflow, removing leaf litter, and applying fungicide sprays during spore release periods." 
Apple___Black_rot,"Black rot, caused by *Botryosphaeria obtusa*, leads to concentric dark lesions on apple leaves and fruit. Infected fruit shrivels and develops sunken, blackened rots, often with a dry, brittle texture. The fungus thrives in warm, humid environments and survives winter in cankers and mummified fruit. Management includes removing infected material, pruning for ventilation, and timely fungicide application." 
Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,"Cedar‑apple rust is a fungal disease that cycles between apple and eastern red cedar hosts. On apple, it forms bright orange, convex lesions on leaves with yellow halos; fruit may show raised, spongy spots. The pathogen overwinters on cedar as galls and releases spores in spring. Disease control requires pruning infected branches, avoiding nearby cedars, and applying protective fungicides during wet conditions in spring." 
Apple___healthy,"A healthy apple leaf exhibits a uniform green color, intact edges and veins, and no visible lesions, spots, discoloration, or deformation—indicative of a plant functioning optimally without disease stress." 
Corn___Common_rust,"Common rust of corn, caused by *Puccinia sorghi*, produces elongated reddish‑brown pustules on both leaf surfaces. These pustules erupt spores that spread via wind, reducing photosynthetic area and potentially lowering yield. The disease is most active in moderate, moist climates. Management includes resistant hybrids and crop rotation to lower inoculum." 
Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight,"Northern leaf blight, driven by *Exserohilum turcicum*, causes long, tan-gray lesions parallel to leaf veins that may coalesce and destroy large areas of foliage. Late-season infections can severely threaten yield. The pathogen overwinters in crop debris and appears under cool, wet conditions. Crop rotation, resistant hybrids, and residue management are key for control." 
Corn___healthy,"A healthy corn leaf has a smooth, uniform green appearance without any spots, lesions, discoloration or structural damage, indicating optimal plant health." 
Grape___Black_rot,"Grape black rot, caused by *Guignardia bidwellii*, starts with small brown circular spots on leaves, eventually forming black fungal structures. Fruit become mummified, turning hard, black, and raisin-like—commonly referred to as “mummies.” The fungus thrives in warm, humid weather, overwinters in mummies and dead tissue, and spreads via rain‑splash and airborne spores." 
Potato___Early_blight,"Early blight of potato, caused by *Alternaria solani*, manifests as concentric, dark brown “bull’s‑eye” rings on older leaves, leading to chlorosis and defoliation. Stems and tubers may also develop dry, leathery spots. The fungus persists in soil and plant debris and favors warm, humid conditions. Control tactics include crop rotation, removal of debris, and fungicide treatments." 
Potato___Late_blight,"Late blight, driven by *Phytophthora infestans*, is a fast‑acting oomycete disease that produces water‑soaked brown lesions on leaves and stems, often with a green‑gray border. Tubers develop reddish-brown decay that can quickly become mushy. Ideal conditions are cool, wet weather. It survived through the Irish Potato Famine. Management includes fungicide applications, certified disease‑free seed, and removal of infected plants." 
Potato___healthy,"A healthy potato leaf shows vibrant green coloration, no spots or lesions, intact structure, and signs of vigorous growth." 
Tomato___Bacterial_spot,"Bacterial spot in tomato is caused by *Xanthomonas* spp., presenting small dark, water-soaked lesions with pale yellow halos on leaves and fruit. Severe infections cause defoliation and blemished fruit. The pathogen spreads via splashing water and plant contact. Crop sanitation, copper-based bactericides, and resistant varieties help reduce its impact." 
Tomato___Early_blight,"Early blight in tomato, caused by *Alternaria solani*, is marked by concentric brown rings on older leaves, often surrounded by yellow halos. Stems may exhibit target-like lesions and fruit can rot. The fungus overwinters in crop residue and thrives in warm, wet weather. Effective control includes crop rotation, proper spacing, mulching, and fungicide sprays." 
Tomato___Late_blight,"Tomato late blight—a severe disease caused by *Phytophthora infestans*—produces irregular, water-soaked brown lesions on leaves with a greenish border, and may show white fuzzy sporulation on the underside. Fruit display greasy brown spots that enlarge rapidly. The disease spreads rapidly under cool, humid conditions and requires aggressive fungicide programs and destruction of infected plants." 
Tomato___Leaf_Mold,"Tomato leaf mold, caused by *Fulvia fulva* (formerly *Cladosporium fulvum*), appears as yellow spots on upper leaf surfaces and gray-green velvety growth underneath. It thrives in conditions of high humidity and poor air circulation. Infected leaves wither and drop. Management involves increasing ventilation, removing affected leaves, and applying fungicides." 
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,"Septoria leaf spot of tomato, caused by *Septoria lycopersici*, shows small, circular cream spots with dark borders on lower leaves. Lesions often include tiny black fruiting bodies. It leads to defoliation, reducing yield. The fungus survives in infected debris, thriving in warm, moist environments. Crop sanitation and fungicide use are recommended." 
Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite,"Two‑spotted spider mites are tiny arachnids that feed by puncturing leaf cells, causing yellow stippling and fine webbing, typically on undersides. Heavy infestations bronzify leaves, leading to leaf drop and plant stress. High temperatures and drought increase mite populations. Management includes releasing predatory mites or applying miticides and maintaining humidity." 
Tomato___Target_Spot,"Target spot in tomato, caused by *Corynespora cassiicola*, creates irregular concentric ring lesions with yellow halos on foliage. Disease progresses in warm, wet conditions and can cause defoliation. The fungus survives on plant debris and spread through water splashes. Prevention includes sanitation and timely fungicide sprays." 
Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is transmitted by whiteflies and causes severe stunting, upward leaf curl, and yellow mosaic patterns. Infected plants produce few fruits and suffer reduced yield. The virus is persistent in plants and whiteflies. Control strategies include using resistant varieties, controlling whiteflies, and removing infected plants." 
Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,"Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) causes mottled or mosaic leaf patterns, leaf distortion, and occasional fruit deformation. The virus remains viable on surfaces and seed. It spreads mechanically via tools, hands, or grafting. Management includes sanitation, resistant cultivars, and using certified disease‑free seed." 
Tomato___healthy,"A healthy tomato leaf appears uniformly green with smooth edges, firm tissue, and no lesions, spotting, or discolorations—indicating optimal plant health."
